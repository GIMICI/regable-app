- 11 different accent colors are supported.
- Support `Atom One` code highlighting.

## Desktop App

The Reqable desktop supports Windows/Mac/Linux and integrates API debugging and API testing. You can think of it as Fiddler/Charles + Postman.

Reqable breaks down the barrier between API debugging and testing. For example, APIs can be created from a recording list, and recording can also be performed during API testing.

#### 1. API Debugging

Reqable uses the classic MITM proxy method for debugging and supports such as rewriting, scripting (Python), breakpoints, and replay.

- [x] Support HTTP/1.x and HTTP2 protocol, HTTP3 (QUIC) is not supported yet.

- [x] Breakpoint: Perform real-time breakpoint operations on requests or responses.
- [x] Scripting: Support for writing Python scripts to process requests or responses.
- [x] Mirroring: Configure mirror mapping for the specified domain name and port.
- [x] API testing: Compose APIs from the recording list.
- [x] History: Automatically save the recording list for easy retrospective viewing.

## Mobile App

Reqable plans to launch a standalone mobile app. But I am currently still focusing on the desktop, the development of the mobile app will start as early as September, it depends on the progress of the desktop. Reqable is developed using Flutter and C++ and needs to be adapted to some specific platforms and interactive methods. I believe that the first version of the mobile app will be released soon.
